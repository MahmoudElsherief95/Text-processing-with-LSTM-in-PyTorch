        "In this assignment you will a train an LSTM to generate text. To be able to feed text into (recurrent) neural networks we first have to choose a good representation. There are several options to do so ranging from simple character embeddings to more sophisticated approaches like [word embeddings](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-word-embedding-and-word2vec-652d0c2060fa) or [token embeddings](https://medium.com/@_init_/why-bert-has-3-embedding-layers-and-their-implementation-details-9c261108e28a). We will use a character embedding in this assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Character embeddings work as follows. First we define an alphabet, a set of characters that we want to be able to represent. To feed a character into our network we use a one-hot vector. The dimension of this vector is equal to the size of our alphabet and the \"hot\" position indicates the character we want to represent. While this is logically a decent representation (all characters have the same norm, are orthogonal to one another, etc.) it is inefficient in terms of memory because we have to store a lot of zeros. In the first layer of our network we will multiply our one-hot vector with a weight matrix, i.e. we compute the preactivation by a matrix-vector product of the form $We_i$, where $e_i$ is the $i$-th canonical basis vector. This operation corresponds to selecting the $i$-th column of $W$. So an efficient implementation is to perform a simple lookup operation in $W$. This is how embedding layers work also for word or token embeddings. They are learnable lookup tables.\n",

        "\n",
        "Write a class `Encoder` that implements the methods `__init__` and `__call__`. The method `__init__` takes a string as argument that serves as alphabet. The method `__call__` takes one argument. If it is a string then it should return a sequence of integers as `torch.Tensor` of shape  representing the input string. Each integer should represents a character of the alphabet. The alphabet consists of the characters matched by the regex `[a-z0-9 .!?]`. If the input text contains characters that are not in the alphabet, then `__call__` should either remove them or map them to a corresponding character that belongs to the alphabet. If the argument is a `torch.Tensor`, then the method should return a string representation of the input, i.e. it should function as decoder."

However, this is pretty expensive in terms of compute so we will provide you with a setting that should work quite well. Train your model for 30 epochs using `torch.optim.Adam`. Validate your model after every epoch and persist the model that performs best on the validation set using `torch.save`. Visualize and discuss the training and validation progress."

        "Write a function `topk_accuracy` that takes a list of integers $k$, a model, and a data loader and returns the top-$k$ accuracy of the model on the given data set for each $k$. A sample is considered to be classified correctly if the true label appears in the top-$k$ classes predicted by the model. Then load the best model from the previous exercise using `torch.load` and plot its top-$k$ accuracy as a function of $k$ for all possible values of $k$. Discuss the results."

        "The Huffman code is an algorithm to compress data. It encodes symbols with different lengths depending on their frequencies. It assigns a short code to frequent symbols and a longer code to rare symbols to minimize the average code length. We provide you with an implementation that given a list of frequencies `freqs` returns a list of their respective binary codes as strings in the same order. In fact, `freqs` may contain any real numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "With a model that predicts the next symbol we can achieve even shorter codes. At every time step we can use the predicted probabilities as frequencies for the Huffman code. That is, we use a new code at every time step. This code is governed by the model's belief what the next symbol will be. If the model predictions are good, we will mostly use very short codes.\n",

Add a temperature to the softmax and tune it. How many bits per symbol can you save by using the LSTM and what is the optimal temperature?"
